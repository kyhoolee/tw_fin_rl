### **Slide 2: Introduction**
- **Content:**
  - **Overview:** Financial markets facilitate trading of stocks and bonds (Fama 1970). Challenges include portfolio management (maximizing returns) and market-making (profit from spread + inventory risk).
  - **RL in Finance:** RL enables agents to learn from environments, maximizing cumulative rewards (Sutton & Barto 2018). Advantages: Online learning, captures nonlinear/non-stationary data.
  - **Related Work:** Compares with Fischer (2018), Pricope (2021), Charpentier et al. (2021).
  - **Contribution:** Taxonomies for RL applications; Meta-analysis; Challenges & Future directions.
- **Notes:** "RL outperforms traditional models (ARMA, factor models) by adapting to dynamic environments."

---

### **Slide 3: RL Overview (Preliminary - Part 1)**
- **Content:**
  - **RL Algorithms:** Categorized: Model-Free (Actor-Only, Critic-Only, Actor-Critic) vs Model-Based.
  - **Figure 1 from Paper:** Insert frequency chart of RL algorithms (Actor-Only most common).
  - **Model-Free:** Learns without modeling dynamics (e.g., Policy Gradient - PG, PPO).
  - **Model-Based:** Models environment dynamics.
- **Notes:** "Model-Free dominates literature due to its applicability in noisy financial data."

---

### **Slide 4: RL Overview (Preliminary - Part 2)**
- **Content:**
  - **Actor-Only:** Updates policy only (e.g., PG: Optimizes parameters; PPO: Clips surrogate objective).
  - **Critic-Only:** Updates value function (e.g., Q-Learning: Updates Q-values).
  - **Actor-Critic:** Combines both (e.g., A2C, DDPG).
  - **Vs. Precision Medicine:** Finance: Infinite horizon, multi-agent; Medicine: Finite, single-agent.
- **Notes:** "Finance RL is typically online with simulators/real data, unlike offline healthcare RL."

---

### **Slide 5: RL Applications in Finance (Overview)**
- **Content:**
  - **3 Key Domains:** Market Making, Portfolio Management, Optimal Execution.
  - **MDP Formulations:** State (inventory, spread, imbalance); Action (bid/ask, size); Reward (PnL, inventory penalty).
  - **Key Issues:** Non-stationary, long-tail, imbalance. RL addresses via [State, Action, Reward], Replay Buffer, Hierarchical.
- **Notes:** "Paper focuses on recent, high-quality experimental studies."

---

### **Slide 6: Market Making (3.2 - Single-Agent RL)**
- **Content:**
  - **Problem:** Profit from spread while managing inventory risk (Chan & Shelton 2001).
  - **MDP:** State: Inventory, spread, volatility; Action: Bid/ask levels; Reward: PnL - variance penalty.
  - **Examples:** Double SARSA (Mani et al. 2019): Reduces variance; Shaped reward (Spooner et al. 2018): Limits inventory.
  - **Multi-Asset:** Actor-Critic + variance penalty (Guéant & Manziuk 2019).
- **Notes:** "Prioritize shaped rewards penalizing inventory/variance for robustness."

---

### **Slide 7: Market Making (3.2 - Multi-Agent RL)**
- **Content:**
  - **Adversarial:** Adversary (Spooner & Savani 2020): Enhances robustness to market regime shifts.
  - **Competitive:** Ganesh et al. (2019): Learns opponent distribution.
  - **Hierarchical:** Macro-agent (buy/sell) + Micro-agent (quote) (Patel 2018).
  - **Implementation Tip:** Use shaped reward + Adversarial for robustness.
- **Notes:** "Multi-agent systems improve robustness in competitive markets."

---

### **Slide 8: Portfolio Management (3.3 - Bandit Approach)**
- **Content:**
  - **Goal:** Allocate capital to maximize return and control risk.
  - **Bandit (No State Transition):** Thompson Sampling (TS) with PCA-arms (Shen 2015); Blending strategies (Shen & Wang 2016).
  - **When to Use:** Simple, online, less focus on long-term dynamics.
- **Notes:** "Bandit suits scenarios where active exploration is unnecessary."

---

### **Slide 9: Portfolio Management (3.3 - MDP Approach)**
- **Content:**
  - **Deep Networks:** EIIE (RNN/LSTM/CNN) (Jiang 2017); DDPG (Liu 2018); HRPM hierarchical (Wang 2021a).
  - **Domain Knowledge:** AlphaStock (long winners/short losers) (Wang 2019); Regime/sentiment (Li 2019).
  - **Robustness:** Ensemble (Yang 2020); Graph RL (Soleymani & Paquet 2021).
  - **Forecasting:** Attention autoencoder (Lei 2020); Sentiment from news/tweets (Ye 2020).
- **Notes:** "Choose action space (discrete DQN vs continuous DDPG) based on cost."

---

### **Slide 10: Optimal Execution (3.4 - Model-Free RL)**
- **Content:**
  - **Problem:** Split orders to minimize cost/impact (Metrics: PnL, IS, Sharpe).
  - **Model-Free:** Q-Learning (Nevmyvaka 2006); DQN + shaped reward (Lin & Beling 2020a); Oracle distillation (Fang 2021).
  - **Risk-Sensitive:** Utility-based shortfall (Shen 2014).
- **Notes:** "Shaped reward ties to IS/impact/risk; enforce zero-ending inventory."

---

### **Slide 11: Optimal Execution (3.4 - Model-Based & Others)**
- **Content:**
  - **Model-Based:** Learn simulator (Wei 2019); ABIDES (Karpe 2020).
  - **Classical Integration:** Almgren-Chriss (Hendricks & Wilcox 2014).
  - **Inverse RL:** Learn reward from expert (Roa-Vicens 2019).
  - **Tip:** Use model-based if data is scarce; Distillation for stability.
- **Notes:** "Model-based is robust against misspecification."

---

### **Slide 12: Meta-Analysis (4.0-4.1)**
- **Content:**
  - **Objectives:** Q1: MDP design impact? Q2: Training period? Q3: RL algorithms? Q4: Assumptions (slippage, fees)?
  - **RL Premium:** (SR_RL - SR_Baseline)/SR_Baseline (Sharpe ratio comparison).
  - **Q1 (MDP):** State: Adding features slightly ↑ Premium (slope 0.171, p=0.499); Action: No clear impact; Reward: Shaped > Raw (p=0.120).
- **Notes:** "Statistical significance is weak, but shaped rewards show promise."

---

### **Slide 13: Meta-Analysis (4.2-4.3)**
- **Content:**
  - **Q2 (Training Period):** Length has no clear impact (slope 0.023, p=0.591); Recession inclusion doesn’t reduce Premium (p=0.604).
  - **Q3 (Algorithms):** PG vs DQN no significant difference (p=0.640).
- **Notes:** "Robustness depends on design, not training length."

---

### **Slide 14: Meta-Analysis (4.4 & Checklist)**
- **Content:**
  - **Q4 (Assumptions):** Many papers assume slippage=0; Fees 0.20-0.30%.
  - **Checklist:** State: 2-3 quality features; Reward: Sharpe - λ·turnover; Training: Recent + recession; Eval: Net-of-costs, walk-forward.
- **Notes:** "Adjust for real fees/slippage to avoid inflated results."

---

### **Slide 15: Environments & Benchmarking (5.1)**
- **Content:**
  - **3 Types of Env:** Real market (challenging), History replay (Exo-MDP), Simulator (ABIDES).
  - **Exo-MDP:** Suits PM (no impact); Unsuitable for OE/MM (needs counterfactual).
  - **Simulator:** Probabilistic or Agent-based; Reduce sim-to-real gap with randomization.
- **Notes:** "PM can replay history; MM/OE require high-fidelity simulators."

---

### **Slide 16: Packages & Benchmarking (5.2)**
- **Content:**
  - **Benchmarking:** FinRL for PM; MM lacks unified metrics.
  - **Packages:** RLlib, Stable-Baselines, TF-Agents; Finance-specific: FinRL, TensorTrader.
  - **Key Takeaways:** Standardize eval (Sharpe net-of-costs); Use end-to-end pipeline.
- **Notes:** "Need comprehensive benchmarks for model-free RL."

---

### **Slide 17: Challenges (6.1 - Financial Data)**
